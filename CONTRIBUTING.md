## Documentation Standards

### File Organization

- Place documents in the appropriate directory
- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names: `deployment-guide.md`
- Include assets in the same directory's `assets/` folder

### Writing Style

- **Be Clear**: Write for your audience's knowledge level
- **Be Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Be Complete**: Include all necessary information
- **Use Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Active Voice**: "Configure the server" not "The server should be configured"

### Markdown Guidelines

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
- Include a single H1 at the top of each document
- Use fenced code blocks with language specification
- Prefer reference-style links for repeated URLs
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible

### Required Sections

Every document should include:
- **Title** (H1)
- **Purpose/Overview** section
- **Last Updated** date at the bottom
- **Owner** or point of contact

### Code Examples

- Test all code examples
- Include language specification in code blocks
- Provide context and expected output
- Use placeholders like `{{VARIABLE}}` for user-specific values

## Review Process

1. **Technical Accuracy**: Is the information correct?
2. **Clarity**: Is it easy to understand?
3. **Completeness**: Is anything missing?
